# House Market

Imagine you're a real estate investor in King County, USA. You want to buy a house and resell it, aiming for the highest possible profit. In this project, we will explore house sales data from the region to answer the following questions:

- Which house should you buy? What is the estimated purchase cost?
- When should you sell the house? For how much?
- Should you renovate the house to increase its selling price? What changes are recommended? How much value does each renovation option add?
